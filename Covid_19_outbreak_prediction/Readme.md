# Exploratory Data Analysis and Prediction
Its 25th March Afternoon and India has reported its 9th death with 562 total confirmed cases due to COVID-19.
Fresh cases from Manipur, Bihar, Gujrat, and Madhya Pradhesh have been reported by the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare.

As the coronavirus outbreak continues to spread in the country, the question that we as Indians are trying to answer is :

### "Will India be able to tackle this pandemic or are we going to witness another Italy/ S.Korea/ Wuhan?"

## Goal:
We need a strong model that predicts how the virus could spread across different countries and regions. The goal of this task is to build a model that predicts the spread of the virus in the next 7 days.

### Tasks being performed:
1) Analysing the present condition in India(ear March 2020)
2) Is this trend similar to Italy/S. Korea/ Wuhan
3) Exploring the world wide data
4) Forecasting the world wide COVID-19 cases using Prophet **
